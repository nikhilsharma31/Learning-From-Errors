# Learning-From-Errors
The notebooks in this repo were originally provided as templates by the mentors of the project "Learning From Errors".
The Frozen Lake notebook contains the first phase of simple Q-Networks application.
The Lunar Lander notebook contains the second phase code for Deep Q-Network application. For this, we did not apply and code the whole stuff ourselves.
However, we were supposed to optimize the agent's learning parameters.
